# Organizations
This is a simple YAML data store with a simple HTML UI using GitHub Pages, and JavaScript search layer on top.

## Data
There is a single Organizations.yml file in the _data folder, which is then rendered using the index.html.

## Purpose
The purpose is a quick and dirty way to manage conversations with Organizations which can be imported into another system later.

## Boundaries
I have kept resources that are distinct separate using repo boundaries to allow for easier forking and automation, keeping the data stores small.
