- name: Composable Data Systems - Lessons from Apache Calcite Success
  description: |-
    Composable data systems are eating the world. Database engines becoming a commodity. You may have heard some of these claims recently, thanks to the active adoption of projects like Apache Arrow, Velox, Substrait, and others. I wholeheartedly support this trend. In fact, our company, Querify Labs, exists solely to adopt these technologies across different database vendors. However, I hardly see this new stack as a revolution that, in some magical way, opens a plethora of shiny new perspectives to the database market. Instead, this trend started many decades ago, gradually gaining adoption through a series of painful and costly development efforts. And while a composable stack may help companies bootstrap their new projects faster, it barely solves any fundamental problems vendors face when joining competition with mature and well-funded rivals. In this blog post, I would like to share our experience with Apache Calcite — a powerful composable toolset for building query optimizers. Apache Calcite achieved tremendous success, powering query optimization in many popular systems, such as Apache Hive and Apache Flink. But even though such a great library has existed for more than ten years, query optimization development is still remarkably complicated and hardly commoditized. Why is it so? We will discuss which exact technical decisions contributed to Apache Calcite's success, what role community plays in such projects, why it is still so difficult to integrate composable libraries into real products, and why I personally do not believe that composable data systems trend will fundamentally change the competition dynamics in the market, as predicted by influental engineers and researchers.First, we will give a definition of composable systems. Then, we briefly discuss the technology aspects of composable optimizers and Apache Calcite in particular. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from Apache Calcite usage across multiple projects, analyzing which exact problems Apache Calcite can and cannot solve, how proper design, APIs, and community culture contributed to the product's success, and how all these insights can help us build better composable data management frameworks.
